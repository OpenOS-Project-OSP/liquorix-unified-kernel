<!-- AI:start:what-it-does -->
This project provides a unified build and installation system for the Liquorix kernel, designed to work across multiple Linux distributions and architectures. It simplifies the process of building and deploying the Liquorix kernel by offering a consistent interface for various environments, including Debian, Ubuntu, Arch, Fedora, and Gentoo. It is intended for developers and system administrators who need to build and install the Liquorix kernel in a flexible, repeatable manner.

## Architecture

<!-- AI:start:architecture -->
The project consists of a modular build system for compiling and installing the Liquorix kernel across multiple Linux distributions and architectures. The architecture is centered around a `Makefile` that defines build and installation targets, with support for parallel builds, custom kernel versions, and architecture-specific configurations. The build process relies on shell scripts located in the `scripts` directory, while distribution-specific configurations are stored in the `configs` directory. Continuous integration workflows are defined in `.github/workflows`.

└── fastci.config.json   # Configuration for fast CI builds
``` 

Key components interact through the `Makefile`, which orchestrates the build process by invoking scripts and configurations based on the target distribution, release, and architecture.

## CI

<!-- AI:start:ci -->
The repository uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and automation. Below are the workflows and their purposes:

- **build.yml**: Builds the Liquorix kernel for various distributions and architectures. No secrets required.
- **gen-arch-config.yml**: Generates Arch Linux kernel configuration files. No secrets required.
- **labeler.yml**: Automatically labels pull requests based on file changes. No secrets required.
- **release.yml**: Creates and publishes new releases. Requires the `GH_TOKEN` secret for authentication.
- **trigger-artifact-mirror.yml**: Triggers artifact mirroring to external storage. Requires `MIRROR_API_KEY` secret.
- **watch-upstream.yml**: Monitors upstream kernel releases and creates issues for new versions. No secrets required.
