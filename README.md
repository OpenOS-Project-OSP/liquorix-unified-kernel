<!-- AI:start:what-it-does -->
This project provides a unified build and installation system for the Liquorix kernel, designed to work across multiple Linux distributions and architectures. It simplifies the process of building and installing the Liquorix kernel by offering a consistent interface and customizable options for different environments. It is intended for developers and system administrators who need to build or deploy the Liquorix kernel on various platforms.

## Architecture

<!-- AI:start:architecture -->
The Liquorix Unified Kernel project consists of a modular build system designed to support multiple Linux distributions and architectures. The key components include a `Makefile` that defines build and installation targets, a `scripts` directory containing helper scripts, and configuration files for various distributions and architectures. The build process is controlled via `make` commands, with variables such as `DISTRO`, `RELEASE`, `ARCH`, and `KERNEL_VERSION` specifying the target environment. The project also includes GitHub workflows for CI/CD automation.

## CI

<!-- AI:start:ci -->
The repository uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration. Below is a summary of the workflows and their purposes:

- **build.yml**: Builds the Liquorix kernel for supported distributions and architectures. No secrets required.
- **release.yml**: Creates and publishes release artifacts. Requires `GITHUB_TOKEN` for authentication.
- **cleanup-pollution.yml**: Cleans up temporary files and artifacts from previous runs. No secrets required.
- **mirror-releases.yml**: Mirrors release artifacts to external storage. Requires `MIRROR_STORAGE_KEY`.
- **sync-to-gitlab.yml**: Synchronizes the repository with a GitLab mirror. Requires `GITLAB_TOKEN`.
- **rate-limit-status.yml**: Monitors and reports GitHub API rate limits. No secrets required.
- **token-health.yml**: Validates the health of API tokens. Requires `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `GITLAB_TOKEN`.

Refer to the `.github/workflows` directory for detailed configurations. Ensure required secrets are added in the repository settings under "Secrets and variables."
